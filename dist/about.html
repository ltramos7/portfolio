            <p class="text">
              I’m a Chicago native with a passion to give back to the community
              through tech. I seek projects that allow me to provide a solution
              or tool to help bring awareness and equity through my skills of
              software and web devlopment.

          <h2 class="text-secondary">Volunteer</h2>
          <p>
            I volunteer at a non-profit organization called
            <a href="https://www.weallcode.org/" target="_blank" id="small"
              >We All Code</a
            >. I began volunteering with them in 2017 and plan to be with them
            for as long as I can. We All Code serves underserved youth of
            Chicago from ages 7-17. We maintain an average student to mentor
            ratio of 2:1. Our classes ar 100% free to students. We All Code is
            mobile, meaning we find facilities throughout the city who will host
            us as we bring the laptops, curriculum, and volunteers who will help
            lead the class. Not only am I volunteer, I’m also Secretary of the
            Associate Board. It’s amazing to be more involved with an
            organziation that gives back to my Chicago commuity.
          </p>

          <p>
            In response to COVID-19, we have adapted our classes and curriculum
            to be remote friendly. We have seen a return of volunteers who moved
            to different time zones and have seen students attend more often
            than usual since the classes are more accessible. We plan to keep
            the remote classes in additon to our in-person classes when the
            pandemic has subsided.

          <h2 class="text-secondary">Hobbies</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Barbeque! I grew up with barabeques in the summers which meant good
            company, good food, and great memories. I’m currently exploring
            vegetarian options to make sure all friends feel welcomed. If you
            have any suggestions or favorites on vegetarian barbeque dishes,
            please share them with me!
          </p>

          <p>
            The phsycial acitivtiy I enjoy to help maintain health is Ultimate
            Frisbee. It’s a sport that welcomes any level of experience so the
            community is supportive and inviting. My most enjoyable memories are
            playing on the beaches of Chicago in the evenings and jumping in the
            water after our games to cool down and wash some of the sand off.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also enjoy camping, hiking, and kayaking. The fresh outdoors and
            sounds of nature help balance out the city's vehicle exhaust and
            sounds of sirens.
