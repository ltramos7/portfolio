# portfolio

This my portfolio to showcase my projects, practice new skills, and share more about who I am.

Currently, my portfolio uses vanilla JavaScript with SASS. This is to help understand the innerworkings of Bootstrap.

While this version is live, I plan to return to my code to incorportate React and refactor my code to take a more DRY approach.

Any advice or critiques are welcomed!

I hope you enjoy learning about me :)
